# Project Outline

The objective of this project is to study opportunities for post-growth
metropolitan internet access as a means to reduce the environmental impact
of digital technologies. Inspired by Kate Raworth's Doughnut Economics,
post-growth industries strive to operate between the socio-economic floor
corresponding to the satisfaction of the basic needs of all actors
(individuals' fundamental rights and social cohesion but also economic
viability) and the ecological ceiling provided by planetary boundaries that
restrict, e.g., greenhouse-gas emissions and the availability of raw
materials. A post-growth economy must thus occupy that sweet spot of being
profitable within the planetary boundaries and enabling a good life for
all, which requires us to reconsider social, economic, political, and
technical aspects of internet access, here at the metropolitan level.

To reduce the growing energy demands, emission and material footprint of
internet infrastructure, this project will focus on the evolution of data
traffic and the associated rebound effects. Our research hypothesis is
that, to sustainably limit the environmental footprint of internet
infrastructure (and the internet economy at large), data traffic must be
considered as a limited resource that needs to be allocated equitably. In
this context we develop a notion of frugality for the internet as a
socio-technical innovation, where the rollout of new infrastructure to
increase the traffic capacity is substantially reduced and infrastructure
operators would operate existing equipment as long as possible. This raises
many challenges that we aim to address in this project:

- How and under what conditions would this frugal internet gain societal
  acceptance and how would citizens want to define how to use the
infrastructure sustainably?
- How can we transparently and effectively implement network neutrality and
  equitable access to internet resources in a frugal internet? What means
of arbitration are required and how can these be implemented in a
transparent and privacy-preserving way?
- How do we guarantee security and reliability in ageing equipment, and
  recover equipment after failure or compromise?

We aim to answer these questions in two research tracks. Firstly, we will
explore the societal aspect and governance questions regarding a frugal
internet on a qualitative and quantitative level, through surveys and
participatory studies that explore the needs and expectations of
individuals, telecom operators, businesses and policy makers in the
Brussels metropolitan area. Participatory methods will further be used to
prototype use-facing aspects of sustainable/post-growth telecom
infrastructure, e.g., personal or community-wide configuration options, and
to gather feedback regarding notions and the technical feasibility of
these. Secondly, we will study technical aspects of implementing
privacy-preserving arbitration and long-term security in 5G services as an
approach for effective data traffic limitation and sustainability. This
line of work envisions network infrastructure that satisfies strong data
protection and privacy requirements based on Trusted Computing primitives
to ascertain software integrity and to enable private computations. A
quantitative sustainability assessment of the environmental impacts of
technical proposals will be part of the research.

As results of this project, we envision to provide Belgian internet service
providers (ISPs) with a comprehensive assessment of post-growth concepts
for future connectivity regarding their potential societal acceptance,
technical challenges and directions to resolve these in existing 5G
infrastructures, and the expected impacts regarding energy consumption,
greenhouse-gas emissions, and equipment requirements. We believe that our
research will have important uses beyond environmental aspects of the
internet economy but may, for example, also provide insights towards the
operation and socio-economic context of equitable digital infrastructures
as a response to the delayed rollout of 5G infrastructure in Brussels, the
global chip shortage, and growing geopolitical tensions with the European
Union's sources of raw materials and high-tech equipment. Beyond these
immediate and applicable insights, sustainability-focused internet access
can be an enabler for a sustainable economy at large, with extensive
indirect effects on businesses and the social and economic choices of
citizens. Assessing these effects is, however, beyond the scope of this
project.
